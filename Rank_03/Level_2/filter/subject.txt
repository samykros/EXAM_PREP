Assignment

Write a program that will take one and only one argument s. 
Your program will then read from stdin and write all the content 
read in stdout except that every occurance of s must be replaced 
by a "*" (as many as the length of s).

For example:
equivalent to filter.sh
./filter bonjour
Will behave in the same way as:
sed 's/bonjour/******/g'

./filter abc
will behave in the same way as:
sed 's/abc/***/g'

Allowed functions: read, write, strlen, memmem, memmove, malloc, calloc,
realloc, free, perror, fprintf, stderr 


It must be the equivalent of the shell script filter.sh

In case of error during a read or malloc, you must write "Error: " followed by the error message in stderr and return 1.

e.g. this should work:
echo 'abcdefaaaabcdeabcabcdabc' | ./filter  abc | cat -e
***defaaa***de******d***

echo 'ababcabababc' | ./filter ababc | cat -e
*****ab*****$
