Hereâ€™s the corresponding version of the question using execvp:

Question: Function with execvp
Write a function that takes three inputs.

First one: Name of executable like ls or cat.

Second one: Pointer to arguments that the function execvp needs.

Third one: 'r' for read or 'w' for write (redirection).

Return a file descriptor that is connected to the input/output of the executable (depending on if 'r' or 'w').

Functions allowed: execvp(), pipe(), fork(), close(), exit().
